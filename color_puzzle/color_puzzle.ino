/***
 * color puzzle
 *
 * This is the first and simplest puzzle of the Dream Pod experience. 
 * Both players must stop the LED light strip cycle of 8 colors and the same color. 
 * Once both LED strips are synced, the puzzle is complete.
 *
 * TODO 
 * Thomas,
 * Here is my "best shot" trying to blind code this for you. 
 * 
 * I think we may actually be pretty close, so maybe try to plug this in
 * and give it a shot.
 *
 *
 * LedRGB library here = https://github.com/alexbertis/LibreriaLedRGB
 * MPR121 Library here = https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_MPR121
